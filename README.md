# ✈️ Airline Management System with Price Prediction & Data Pipelines

This project is an **Airline Management System** focused on analyzing airline data and predicting flight ticket prices using data analytics and machine learning techniques. It also demonstrates the use of **data pipelines** for structured data processing, cleaning, and feature preparation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Airline Management System aims to streamline airline-related data operations such as flight analysis, fare trends, and price prediction. Using real-world airline data, the project builds an end-to-end pipeline that transforms raw data into meaningful insights and predictive models.

The system is designed as a **data engineering + machine learning mini-project**, making it suitable for academic evaluation and portfolio demonstration.
